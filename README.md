This is my One Month Rails application.  It is an experimentation with using the Devise gem.

Goal 1: install paperclip and let users upload a background picture.
Goal 2: install google maps for ruby gem and make a page that finds outdoor rock climbing areas near the user's address and gives climbing beta (or a link to climbing beta)
